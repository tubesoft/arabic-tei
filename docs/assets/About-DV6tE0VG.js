              <p>
                This webapp offers digital editions of Arabic alchemical literature. TEI P5 is used for the encoding.
                To render from TEI to the reader-friendly webpage, the app is designed with Vue.js (version 3),
                accompanied with Vuetify (version 3, a UI framework) and Saxon-js (version 2, a XSLT engine).
                <br /><br />
                In the future, translation and reference sources will be created in TEI as well.
                In addition, quantitative analysis will be made by taking advantage of TEI endoding.
                <br /><br />
                This webapp is all created by Takatomo Inoue, including editing Arabic sources and coding this webapp.

              <p>
                The edited texts include roughly two types: diplomatic edition and (quasi-)critical edition.
                Bibliographical information, editorial notes, discrepancies, marginal notes are indicated with different colors.
                Some of them show further information by hovering the cursor.
